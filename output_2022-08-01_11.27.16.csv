Ula is reimagining how retail in emerging markets should work in the smartphone era. We’ve witnessed the rise of B2C e-commerce over the last decade in both India and Indonesia. But the small retailer, the heart and soul of retail, has been left largely underserved by e-commerce even though they’re spending hours every day on their smartphones. Ula provides a simple front-end app, powered by sophisticated back-end systems that determine everything from pricing to inventory to intelligent salesforce route planning. We are building many first of their kind technologies in the world and need your help in building the right systems.

Ula is an e-commerce, technology start-up headquartered in Singapore, with offices in Bangalore and Jakarta though we are quite flexible in terms of where our colleagues choose to work from. We are funded by Tier-1 Venture Capital — Tiger Global, Tencent, Sequoia Capital India, Lightspeed India, Prosus and among others is Jeff Bezos via his family office Bezos Expeditions.

We are a culturally diverse company with 38% women and 7 nationalities. We believe that the best minds are required to solve tough problems irrespective of where they come from.

For more details, see https://landing.ula.app/en/

About You

You are driven to solve tough problems with technology. Let’s take pricing for example. Imagine a world where each product in e-commerce were to be priced differently for each customer based on where they are located, how much they buy or where they prepay or pay-later. This leads to a massive optimization problem because pricing too low incurs opportunity cost while pricing too high means a competitor takes that business. This is just one example of how B2B and B2C e-commerce are different and why B2B offers the opportunity to innovate. Now couple this with routing for a sales agent. How should pricing work with a sales-person’s CRM app? Depending on how far you take it, it is a massive machine learning problem.

If you’re passionate about technology and its applications to business problems, you’re curious and imagine what a new world can look like, love working with global colleagues on global problems and don’t mind taking risks that move the needle and treat failure merely as an opportunity to improve and iterate, you’d be a good fit at Ula.

We are very ownership driven at Ula. We also believe in proactive mentorship. It’s an opportunity to learn and to mentor. Below is what we expect from you.

About The Team

As Nasi Goreng is to the people of Indonesia, our Payments team is to Gojek: providing the nourishment to sustain our business from the inside out. We run and oversee one of Southeast Asia's largest merchant platforms, e-money wallet platforms, and Indonesia's leading digital payments provider. Some of the businesses we empower include Tokopedia, Google, Disney+, McDonald's, Blibli, Jd.id, and Kitabisa.

Our service is now accepted at over 300,000 online and offline merchants in Indonesia alone, with our ecosystem processing US$6.3 billion of annualized Gross Transaction Value in 2018. But, the growth of Payments does not stop here. We are hungry for more. We intend to become the largest payment and financial services group in Southeast Asia. It's our job to ensure that this number grows, and more importantly, that anyone utilizing our platform is given the most seamless payment experience possible. How does one achieve this, you may ask? By collaborating diligently with our users to understand the daily obstacles they face in the payment arena, then crafting our products and services to aid these issues.

As a team, we’re concerned not only with the growth of the company, but each other’s personal and professional growths, too. Along with a common drive to jump over technical barriers and provide sustainable solutions, our team bonds over our shared love for tea, movies, and TV shows. With WFH becoming more normalized, you best believe we’ve been sharing our favorite ways to prioritize a healthy work-life balance at home (Netflix, anyone?😜).

WRI Indonesia is an independent research organization that turns big ideas into action at the nexus of environment, economic opportunity, and human well-being. At WRI Indonesia, we aim to bring innovations in research and business approaches in order to create the enabling conditions for Indonesia to achieve robust economic growth while respecting environmental and social values. We seek to contribute to the accomplishment of ambitious sustainable development goals through working with leaders in public and private sectors, as well as collaborating with civil society organizations, in turning big ideas into action.

Within our Agriculture, Forest and Land Use (AFOLU) Program, we envision critical ecosystems such as forests and peatland across Indonesia to be governed fairly and sustainably. We believe sustainable land use management is key for Indonesia to meet its climate goal, in line with keeping the global climate target below the 1.5 degree Celcius warming treshold , while providing sustainable livelihoods to forest-dependent communities and conserve biodiversity in the landscape. We intend to achieve this through safeguarding the remaining forest and peatland from deforestation, degradation, and fragmentation; maintaining forests and peatland quality through sound stewardship; and restoring degraded ecosystem to improve its productivity, conservation value, and ecosystem services.

Indonesia Intact Rainforest Partnership (IIRP)

Indonesia is the eleventh largest emitter of greenhouse gases (GHGs) in the world, and over half of these come from land use change and deforestation. Currently, the majority of the international climate finance to mitigate emissions from deforestation is directed towards jurisdictions with high deforestation rates, rather than supporting those which have kept their forests intact and are committed to continuing to do so. With the emerging global emphasis on nature-based solutions, there is also a growing understanding of the crucial importance of intact forests and their rich biodiversity and cultures. It is infinitely more beneficial and cost effective to preserve existing forest systems than to restore them after the trees have been felled, their communities dispossessed, and the biodiversity and ecosystems services damaged irrevocably.

Indonesia Intact Rainforest Partnership aims to catalyze the implementation of a low-carbon development plan in four intact forest provinces, namely Papua, West Papua, North Kalimantan, and Aceh. It consists of policies, programs, and investments that advance local economic development, improve resident well-being, and avoid deforestation.

Forest Monitoring

To effectively safeguard the remaining forest and peatland, WRI Indonesia champions the use of technology solutions such as our cutting-edge Global Forest Watch platform to strengthen forest monitoring through publicly-accessible and actionable forest data and insights. Global Forest Watch (GFW) is the only free online platform providing near real time information and analysis about when, where and why forests are changing around the world. GFW uses machine learning algorithms and expert analysis to distill satellite imagery, crowdsourced information, and hundreds of open datasets into actionable insights and policy-relevant information about forests worldwide. GFW’s online platform is simple to use, allowing anyone with an internet connection or a mobile phone to access data, create dynamic maps, and produce custom analyses with just a few clicks. Designed for action, GFW enables researchers, government officials, companies, civil society organizations, and concerned citizens anywhere to make better-informed decisions about managing and conserving forests.

Job Responsibilities

The GIS Research Analyst is responsible in leading WRI Indonesia AFOLU research efforts to develop spatial insights to inform key national policy-making processes as well as to support the capacity development program of AFOLU unit on spatial analysis research. The key responsibility of the GIS Research Analyst for IIRP and GFW projects is to develop the spatial research plan and lead the implementation of spatial research on IIRP and GFW projects in coordination with Project Leads.

For Indonesia Intact Rainforest Partnership (IIRP) project, the GIS Research Analyst is mainly responsible to produce basic spatial statistics of IIRP provinces, the development of internal dashboard that contains spatial statistics of IIRP provinces. This includes matrixed information on IIRP land cover information, concessions, spatial planning zones, and other legal designation of the area that is relevant for IIRP goals. The GIS research analyst is also responsible to provide GIS data, analysis, and advices for development of NBS Coalition Mapping Tool, a tool that is developed by NBS Coalition to leverage climate financing opportunity for intact rainforest protection and other nature-based solution in South East Asia.

In supporting the GFW, the GIS Research Analyst is responsible to improve the accuracy and quality of forest-related datasets, and develop spatial insights to inform key national policy-making processes. This includes conducting in-depth spatial analysis and statistics on forest dynamics, deforestation trend analysis, as well as the performance of community forestry in halting deforestation.

About The Team

Our Payments team oversees GoPay (Southeast Asia’s fastest-growing consumer payments and financial services app), as well as Midtrans (one of Indonesia’s largest payment gateways), and Spots (Indonesia’s largest offline network for payments).

Our Merchant Payments team is part of the larger Payments platform and consists of passionate engineers based in Jakarta, Singapore, and Gurgaon. We run Southeast Asia’s leading financial platform for online and onsite merchants. It's our job to oversee all things related to empowering business owners and creating a seamless and efficient payment gateway solution. We also take the time to understand our merchant-partners daily concerns and experiences in order to cater our services to resolve any hurdles and expand their operations. The big question that we’re always trying to solve is: How can we better improve our digital experience for our merchants-partners.

We've helped simplify payments for over 300,000 merchant-partners in our respective regions - from retail stores in town to your favorite Gorengan and Martabak stalls. But, the growth of Payments does not stop here. We are hungry for more. We intend to become the largest payment and financial services group in Southeast Asia. We are working on several projects now, including one about enhancing direct interaction with our merchant-partners of a variety of businesses and their customers.

We’re a high-performing, tight-knit team who are committed to the growth of the company, as well as each other’s personal growth and well-being. Pre-COVID, factions of our team would enjoy catching up over a round of drinks after work. However, with WFH becoming more normalized, we've been sharing our favorite ways to prioritize a healthy work-life balance at home. Off-hours, you’d probably find us binging The Queen’s Gambit on Netflix, whipping up a loaf of sourdough bread, or trying our best to survive a HIIT workout on YouTube.

Diversity and Inclusivity at Zapier

About You
You have 2 years or more experience, and you consider yourself a Rewards whiz and are looking to expand your experience. Your experience should include some time working in Compensation, and exposure to benefits would be a plus.
You have a love and hate relationship with analytics, reporting, and surveys - you love the data that drives decision-making but understand the hard work that goes into survey participation and market research. You’re up for the challenge of wrangling data and turning it into actionable information.
You LOVE Excel or Google Sheets and you’re a wizard at manipulating data and turning it into digestible charts that tell the story behind the data. Creating multiple-row formulas excites you and you’ve been known to get an eye-roll when you get excited about learning a new data trick
You have strong attention to detail that you noticed the out-of-place period at the end of the sentence in the 3rd bullet above! The analytics and research you’ll provide will be integral to delivering best-in-class programs so it’s important you carry about the small and big details.
Do you often have multiple tabs opened on your web browser? Some would say that’s hectic, but we call it organized chaos! Either way, you are great at time management, prioritizing work, and keeping track of things.
Teamwork makes the dream work is not just a saying; you are able to effectively collaborate in a team, and communicate your ideas and recommendations in a clear, compelling, and engaging way, both verbal and written.
Things You’ll Do
It takes a lot to keep the Rewards team functioning smoothly! You’ll be the primary owner of Total Rewards tools, applications, and content (CAT, Payfactors, Pave, Trinet, Glide, Bamboo, etc.) including reporting and analysis (e.g. ongoing employee analytics [pay equity review], benefits program utilization, equity cap table reporting, and working with the different Rewards functions to keep process documentation updated).
Partner with other People and Ops departments to deliver on programatic processes like providing salary ranges to Talent Acquisition or providing bonus proration reports to Payroll.
One of our Rewards Guiding principles is data-driven decision making. You’ll play a critical role in ensuring we lean into this principle by leading market research and trend analysis. This will include rewards survey participation and identifying new surveys and trend reports.
Project member or lead across Total Rewards projects where aligned to role; some key annual projects you’ll engage in are:
Project Lead - Annual Market Review and Analysis
Analysis of market changes and make recommendations for changes; present findings to Compensation Team + Head of Total Rewards for approval and sign-off
Implement changes (e.g. updates to salary ranges, headcount planning, and recruiter tools)
Communication and training
Project Member - Annual Salary Review (Pave system and ASR training)
Will drive systems enhancements and systems training
Will drive updates to ASR process communication and training materials

Are you driven by creativity, bold ideas, and disruptive innovation? Are you inspired by exceptionally talented, diverse, impact-oriented colleagues? Do you thrive in a dynamic, high-growth, fast-paced environment? Then consider a job with ThinkWell.

ThinkWell is a growing, flexible health systems organization, with both global influence and local grounding. Our focus is on driving transformation in the global health space by always questioning and disrupting conventional wisdom about what works or what can or cannot be done. We believe in pragmatisms over ideology and develop solutions tailored to a client’s context and political realities without replicating global models and all-purpose solutions. We know that to drive change, we must focus on how the world could be, rather than making excuses for the status quo.

Strategic Purchasing for Primary Health Care (SP4PHC) is a five-year program supported by a grant from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation that supports countries to improve how funds are allocated to healthcare providers in order to achieve the goal of universal health coverage. ThinkWell is working with purchasers and policy makers in five countries (Indonesia, Philippines, Kenya, Burkina Faso, and Uganda) to design and test policy options to more effectively purchase primary health care (PHC) services.

SP4PHC Indonesia is partnering with the Government of Indonesia (GOI) on three strategies, including (1) working with Indonesia’s national health insurance scheme (JKN) to improve how it purchases health services, (2) strengthening how district health offices purchase services from PHC providers, as well as (3) supporting GOI in the development of telemedicine and digital health in Indonesia.

Additionally, key activities will also include exploration of how digital health and data can support and improve purchasing mechanisms in alignment with GOI’s transformation agenda in digital health, assessing the possibility of public and private sector partnership in telemedicine and how services based on telemedicine can be implemented in PHC and hospital services as well as integrated into JKN system.

Key purchasing topics that should be explored include how the MOH or BPJSK can contract and reimburse telemedicine providers, the regulations and policies that need to be in place to underpin the integration of telemedicine and what this sequence may look like, linkage between telemedicine providers with other PHC providers in the health system, and how telemedicine can be expanded to cover non-COVID-19 services and what needs it could fill (e.g. non-communicable disease monitoring, FP counseling).

This is a full-time staff position based in Jakarta, Indonesia. The Telemedicine Strategy Analyst will work closely with Senior Telemedicine Policy Expert along with the stakeholders within the Indonesian Ministry of Health, specifically Digital Transformation Office and Center for Data and Information Technology (Pusat Data dan Teknologi Informasi; PUSDATIN) to support telemedicine programs and other digital related health related projects.

Our team consists of multinational and multi-background individuals, working together to anticipate and predict potential threats to our platform, design and build tools to fight against and mitigate these threats, and implement and enforce these systems at scale. We partner closely with several cross-functional teams to ensure safe and secure transactions for our users, our Gojek businesses, and our extended ecosystem.

Our team is constantly working on projects that continuously bolster our platform, maintain Gojek’s overall integrity, and improve the resilience of our ecosystem across all the countries and regions we operate in. This is a particularly exciting time to join our family as we’re focused on scaling this team to support Gojek’s growing markets, businesses, and future product launches, propelling our services to all corners of the globe.
